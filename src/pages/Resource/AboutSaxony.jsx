            Saxony borders Poland to the east and the Czech Republic to the
            south. Lusatia,the eastern part of Saxony, has been home to the
            Sorbs, a Slavic ethnic group with its own culture and labuage, for
            more than 1,000 years.

          <p className="resource-headers">Climate</p>
          <p className="resource-text">
            Due to its locationin the east of Germany and its distance from the
            Atlantic ocean, the climatein Saxony is more continental in
            character than in other German federal states. This means that there
            is generally less rainfall and it is colder in winter and warmer in
            summer compared to other federal states.
          </p>
          <p className="resource-text">
            In general, the climate is characterised by the seasons of spring,
            summer, autumn and winter. In spring (March - May), a rainer period
            begins and temperatures rise increasingly to an average of 5&deg; to
            15&deg; Celsius.There can be big differences between day and night
            temperatures. Untill mid-may, frost can still occurat night,
            especially in the mountainous regions in the south of Saxony.summer
            (June - August) is the warmest and brightest season with
            temperaturesranging from 20&deg; to over 30&deg; Celcius. Due to the
            high temperatures, thunderstorms with heavy rain, lightning and
            thunder occur more frequently. In autumn (September - November) ,
            the days get shorter again and it gets colder. Temperatures range
            from 18&deg; to 5&deg; Celcius and it rains more frequently again
            especially in November. Winter (December - February) is the coldest
            season with average temperatures between 5&deg; and -5&deg; Celcius.
            The days are short with often little sunshine
          </p>

          <p className="resource-text">
            Vegetation follows the seasons,which means that nature comes back to
            life in spring after a dormant period in winter. the trees and
            plants begin to grow and blossom and produce their fruit over the
            course of the summer. The late summerand early autumn is the main
            harvest time in Saxony. After this, the trees lose their leaves due
            to the falling temperatures, the plants wither and nature comes to
            rest untill the next spring beings.
